# Scanning
Updating the Scanner App to be more akin Fluent Design because Microsoft doesn't do it :)

## Main goals
* Make scanning as easy as the ['Windows Scanner'-app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-scan/9wzdncrfj3pv) by Microsoft
* Build the design akin the [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/) by Microsoft
* Keep the design simple and efficient

## About development
The development will all be done in the open. This means that from start to finish I'll work through this project while everyone can watch the project grow from the quick and dirty beginnings to maybe a lot of improvements in the code.

It'll start with basic code behind in the beginning, with the goal to make it with MVVM patterns later on.

For documentation, progress info and goals to work towards you can check the Issues, Projects and Wiki.
